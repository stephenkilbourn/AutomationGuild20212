# Demonstrating @testing-library/react 
This was created for my presentation in the  [Automation Guild 2022](https://guildconferences.com/ag-2022/)
It is focused on demonstrating the capabilities of [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/) for testing a form.  The demonstration form was quickly derived from [my own solution](https://github.com/stephenkilbourn/adventofcss2021) to the 2021 [Advent of CSS](https://www.adventofcss.com/) challenge.


## Viewing the form

```sh
npm start
```

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```sh
npm test
```
